- Noise is an unwanted anomaly in the data
- Due to noise, the class may be more difficult to learn
- With noise in the dataset, zero error may be infeasible with a simple hypothesis class
- Interpretations of noise:
	- Imprecision in recording the input attributes
	- Errors in labeling the data points
	- Hidden attributes that affect the label of an instance.
