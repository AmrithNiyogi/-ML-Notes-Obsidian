- Aim to build good approximation to target class, $r$ using a model. For this three decisions are to made - 
	1. Model
		- $$g( x | \theta)$$
	2. Loss Function
		- $$E(\theta|X) = \sum_{t} L(r^{t}\ ,\ g(x^t|\theta))$$

	1. Optimization Procedure
		- $$\theta^{* }= argmin_{\theta} \  E(\theta | X)$$
