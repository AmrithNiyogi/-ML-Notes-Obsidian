- With noise, need a more complex model with a larger number of parameters
- Another way, to use the simpler one because:
	- Simpler to use (lower computational complexity)
	- Easier to train and few parameters (lower space complexity, less variance but more bias)
	- Easier to explain (more interpretable)
	- Generalizes better - Simple (but not too simple) model than a complex model (lower variance - Occam's razor)
	- Optimal model - minimizing both the bias and the variance
