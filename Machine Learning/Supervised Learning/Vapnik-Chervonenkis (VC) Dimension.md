- N points can be labeled in $2^N$ ways as +/-
- H shatters N if $\exists$ there exist h E H consistent for any of these:
	- **VC(H) = N**
- VC Dimension of a H is the largest number of points that H can shatter
- It is enough that we find 4 points that can be shattered; not necessary to shatter any 4 points in 2-d
- Example: An axis-aligned rectangle shatters 4 points only.
