- Two critical sources of error in machine learning models that influence their performance
	- **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions; does not capture underlying complexities of data.
	- **Variance**: error due to model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data.
- Underfitting - **High Bias, Low Variance**
	- Happens because it doesn't understand the data in its entirety.
- Overfitting - **Low Bias, High Variance**
	- All data is included, but too much variance in the data to give a correct output.

#### Low Bias, Low Variance - IDEAL
