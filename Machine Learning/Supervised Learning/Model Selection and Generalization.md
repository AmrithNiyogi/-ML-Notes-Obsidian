- **Intercept Learning:** 
	- Start with all possible hypothesis and then remove those hypothesis which are not consistent with training data to end with a single hypothesis.
- Learning is an **ill-posed problem**; data is not sufficient to find a unique solution.
- The need for **inductive bias**, assumptions about H for unique solutions.
	- E.g. In family cars: assuming rectangular H is inductive bias; choosing rectangle with max margin is another inductive bias.
- **Model Selection:** 
	- Choosing right bias.
- **Generalization:** 
	- How well a model performs on new data.
- Underfitting: 
	- H less Complex than C or f
- Overfitting: 
	- H more complex than C or f
