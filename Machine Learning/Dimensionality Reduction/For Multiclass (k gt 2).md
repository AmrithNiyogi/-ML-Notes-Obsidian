- Within-class scatter:
	- $$S_{W} = \sum^{K}_{i=1}S_{i}$$
	- $$S_{i} = \sum_{t} r^{t}_{i}(x^{t}-m_{i})(x^{t}-m_{i})^r$$
- Between-class scatter:
	- $$S_{B} = \sum_{i=1}^{K}N(m_{i} - m)(m_{i} - m)^{r}$$
	- $$m = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{K}m_{i}$$
- Find $W$ that max
	- $$J(W) = \frac{|W^{T}S_{B}W|}{|W^{T}S_{W}W|}$$
- The largest eigenvectors of $S_{W}^{-1}S_{B}$ are the solution
