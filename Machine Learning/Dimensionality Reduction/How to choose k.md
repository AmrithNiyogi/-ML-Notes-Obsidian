- Choose k principal components that explain a significant portion of total variance.
- For example, choose the top components that together explain 90% of the variance.
- Proportion of variance (PoV) explained
	- $$\frac{{\lambda{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{3} + \dots \lambda_{k}}}{{\lambda{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{3} + \dots \lambda_{k}+\dots+\lambda_{d}}}$$
	- when $\lambda$, are sorted in descending order
- If dimensions are highly correlated then there will be a small number of eigenvectors with large eigenvalues, then k will be very small.
