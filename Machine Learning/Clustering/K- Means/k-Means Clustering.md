- Each cluster is defined by a centroid
- Partitioning Criterion - 
	- $$\vec{\mu}(\omega) = \frac{1}{|\omega|}\sum_{\vec{x} \epsilon \omega} \vec{x}$$
- Try to find minimum average squared difference by iterating two steps - 
	- Reassignment:
		- Assign each vector to its closes centroid
	- Re-computation: 
		- Recompute each centroid as the average of the vectors that were assigned to it in reassignment
