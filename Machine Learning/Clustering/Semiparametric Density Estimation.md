- Parametric:
	- Assumes a single density function $p(x|C_{i})$$p(x|C_{i})$
	- Pros:
		- Problem is reduced to estimation of small number of parameters
	- Cons:
		- Parametric models are rigid, may increases bias.
- Semi-parametric:
	- $p(x|C_{i})$ is a mixture of densities
	- E.g., Optical Character Recognition, Speech Recognition 
- Non-parametric:
	- No structure to the data
