- Probabilistic approach to find component density parameters and maximize the likelihood of the sample
- Log Likelihood,
	- $$L(\phi|X) = \log \prod_{t} p(x^{t}|\phi) = \sum_{t} \log \sum_{i=1}^{k}p(x^{t}|G_{i})P(G_{i})$$
- Let X be the observable variables and z be the hidden variables
- Log Likelihood: 
	- $L(\phi|X)$, in terms of **x**(incomplete)
- Complete likelihood:
	- $L_{c}(\phi|X)$, in terms of **x** and **z**
