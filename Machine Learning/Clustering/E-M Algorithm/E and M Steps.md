- E step:
	- Estimate z when given X and current $\phi$
- M Step:
	- Find new $\phi^{'}$ when given, x, z and old $\phi$;
	- $\phi^{'}$ that maximizes E-step
- Iterate two steps:
	- E-Step
		- $$Q(\phi|\phi^{'}) = E[L_{c}(\phi|X,Z)|X,\phi^{'}]$$
	- M-Step
		- $$\phi^{l+1} = argmax_{\phi} Q(\phi|\phi^{'})$$
- It's been proved by Dempster, Laird and Robin that:
	- An increase in Q increases incomplete likelihood
	- $$L(\phi^{(l+1)}|X) \ge L(\phi^{'}|X)$$
