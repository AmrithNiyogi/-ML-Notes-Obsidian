- Dimensionality reduction methods find correlations between features and group features
- Clustering methods find similarities between instances and group instances
	- Allows knowledge extraction through number of clusters
	- prior probabilities
	- cluster parameters - center, range of features, etc
	- E.g., custom relationship management
