- If-Then Rules can be generated in two ways:
	- Tree Induction: 
		- BFS; finds all paths simultaneously
	- Rule Induction: 
		- DFS; find path at a time
- Each rule is a conjunction of conditions on attributes
- Rule covers an example if example satisfies all conditions of the rule

- Sequential Covering: 
	- Generates one rule at a time, added to the rule base and all examples covered by the rule are removed from training set; process continues till enough rules are added in rule base
- Well known Rule Induction Algorithms:
	- IREP (FÃ¼rnkrantz and Widmer, 1994)
	- Ripper (Cohen, 1995)
