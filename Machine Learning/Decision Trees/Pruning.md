- Remove subtrees for better generalization (decrease overfitting)
	- Pre Pruning:
		- Stopping tree construction early on before it is complete
	- Post Pruning:
		- Grow the whole tree until all leaf nodes are pure and then prune subtrees that overfit on the <font color="#00b0f0">pruning set.</font>
- Pruning Set:
	- Used to calculate performance of tree to avoid overfitting.
	- Different from validation set
- Pre-pruning is faster
- Post-pruning gives more accurate trees
