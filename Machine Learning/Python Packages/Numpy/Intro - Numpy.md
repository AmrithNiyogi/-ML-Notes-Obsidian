NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays (including multi-dimensional arrays), mathematical functions, and tools for working with these arrays efficiently. NumPy's main features include:

- **Array Creation**: Functions to create arrays of various shapes and types.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Element-wise operations and mathematical functions.
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations and linear algebra routines.
- **Random Sampling**: Random number generation and distribution.
- **Interfacing with Data**: Reading and writing data to files.
- **Performance**: Fast operations on large data sets due to optimized C code.
- NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
