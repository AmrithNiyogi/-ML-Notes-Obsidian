- Python lists are excellent, general-purpose containers. They can be “heterogeneous”, meaning that they can contain elements of a variety of types, and they are quite fast when used to perform individual operations on a handful of elements.

- Depending on the characteristics of the data and the types of operations that need to be performed, other containers may be more appropriate; by exploiting these characteristics, we can improve speed, reduce memory consumption, and offer a high-level syntax for performing a variety of common processing tasks. NumPy shines when there are large quantities of “homogeneous” (same-type) data to be processed on the CPU.
