- Parametric: 
	- Single model valid over whole space
- Semi-Parametric: 
	- Small number of parametric models
- Nonparametric: 
	- Similar inputs have similar outputs
- Given x, find similar/closest past instances from training set and interpolate from these to find right output
- Nonparametric builds local models as needed
- Keep the training data; let the data speak for itself
- Aka lazy/memory-based/case-based/instance-based learning
