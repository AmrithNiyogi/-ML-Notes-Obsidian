- Exploiting Local Input Structure
	- Relevant for vision, speech processing
	- Nearby inputs (pixels, time-series data) are correlated
- Localized Connections
	- Hidden units connect to subsets of inputs
	- Reduces number of parameters
- Hierarchical Feature Learning
	- Successive layers detect increasingly complex features
	- E.g., Pixels → Edges → Shapes → Objects
- Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep learning)
	- Hierarchical cone structure
	- Features become more abstract in higher layers
