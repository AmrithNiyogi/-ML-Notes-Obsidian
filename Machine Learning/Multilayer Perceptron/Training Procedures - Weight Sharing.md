- Use copies of same hidden units in different parts of input space
- Replace independent units with shared - units
- Calculate gradients for different inputs, then take average of these gradients.
- Make single update for shared weights
- Effectively multiplies training set
- Benefits
	- Fewer parameters to learn
	- Improved efficiency and generalization
	- Suited for problems with spatial/temporal =locality
