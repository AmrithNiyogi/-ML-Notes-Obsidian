- Three leveles of analysis (Marr, 1982)
	1. Computational Theory
	2. Representation and algorithm
	3. Hardware implementation
- Brain is a hardware implementation
- Reverse Engoneering: 
	- From H/w implementation to computational theory -> then use another representation and alogorithms and hardware implementation
