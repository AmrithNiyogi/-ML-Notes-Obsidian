- Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience.
- Detection of certain patterns and regularities to understand the process and make predictions.
- Learning is used when:
	- Human expertise does not exist (navigating on Mars)
	- Humans are unable to explain their expertise (image recognition)
	- Solution changes in time (fraud detections)
	- Solution needs to be adapted to particular cases (user biometrics)
