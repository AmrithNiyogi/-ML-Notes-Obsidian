- An algorithm is a <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">set of rules</mark> that a machine follows to achieve a particular goal
	- Can be considered as a recipe that defines the inputs, the output and all the steps needed to get from the inputs to the output.
- A dataset is a <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">table with the data from which the machine learns.</mark>
- The dataset contains the features and the target to predict.
- When dataset is used to induce a model, it is training data.
- An instance is a row in the dataset.
- The features are the inputs used for prediction or classification. A feature is a column in the dataset.
- Categorical variable: 
	- Contain a <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">finite number of categories or distinct groups</mark>. Categorical data might not have a logical order. E.g., categorical predictors include gender, material type, and payment method.
- Discrete variable: 
	- Numeric variables that have a <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">countable number of values between any two values</mark>. A discrete variable is <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">always numeric</mark>. E.g., the number of customer complaints or the number of flaws or defects.
- Continuous variable: 
	- Numeric variables that have an <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">infinite number of values between any two values</mark>. A continuous variable can be <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">numeric or date/time</mark>. E.g., the length of a part or the date and time a payment is received.
- Independent variables (features) are the input variables.
	- Dependent variables are the output of the process.
